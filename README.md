# Travelie

The purpose of this project is to create an application for our Software Structures and Models course. We are second year Software Engineering students at Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. Our team decided to create a travel application for travelers and tourists. The application will help them to plan their holiday better by sorting events and comparing hotels. We are going to use external information about events and hotels in our application.
